# Face-recognition-system
A face recognition system that detects and identifies faces using machine learning and computer vision techniques. Built using OpenCV, Python, and deep learning algorithms for real-time face detection and authentication.

# Features
✅ Face Detection – Identifies human faces in images and live video streams.
✅ Face Recognition – Matches detected faces with known identities.
✅ Real-time Processing – Uses OpenCV and deep learning for fast recognition.
✅ High Accuracy – Utilizes machine learning models for precise identification.
✅ Database Integration – Stores and retrieves face data for authentication.
✅ User Authentication – Can be used for login systems and access control.
✅ Multiple Face Recognition – Detects and recognizes multiple faces at once.
✅ Cross-Platform Support – Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
